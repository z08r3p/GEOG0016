Integrating Satellite and Ground Data for Spatial and Temporal Air 
Pollution in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area 
1 Aims and Objectives The importance of   clean air for   health and   the environment   is clear. To study air quality, satellite   and   ground   data   are   used.   Satellite   data   uses   remote   sensing   to   cover   wide   areas   with   many   details   overtime. Ground   data   gives   accurate   local   readings. However, both   data   sources   have their    limitations(Benavente    et      al.,      2021),      satellite      data      can      be      affected      by      atmospheric   conditions and cloud cover, while   ground-based monitoring   data   has   limited   spatial   coverage.   With   rapid   economic   development   and   population   growth,   Guangdong-Hong   Kong-Macao   Greater   Bay   Area,   is   facing   an   increasingly   serious   air   pollution   problem,   so   integrating   and   analyzing       satellite       observations       and       ground-based      monitoring      data       is       essential      for      a   comprehensive understanding   of air   quality   changes   in   Shenzhen.   The   aim   of this   study   is   to   combine satellite and ground   monitoring data   to conductspatio-temporal analysis of   Shenzhen's   air    quality.    Specifically,    we    will      focus      on      temporal      changes      in      PM2.5          and    O3          levels    in   Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay   Area, and explore differences in how satellite and   ground-based monitoring data represent changes in these air pollutants.
Research Questions:
1.       What are the   differences between   satellite   data   and   ground   data?
2.       What are the   spatio-temporal variations of   PM2.5,   O3    in Guangdong-Hong   Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area?
3.       What factors affect the   variations   of   PM2.5,   O3   in   Guangdong-Hong   Kong-Macao   Greater   Bay Area?
2 Context and Previous Work The   Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao   Greater   Bay Area   is a   city   cluster   consisting   of two   sub-   provincial   cities   of Guangzhou   and   Shenzhen   in   Guangdong Province,   seven prefecture-level   cities   of Zhuhai,   Foshan,   Dongguan,   Zhongshan,   Jiangmen,   Huizhou   and   Zhaoqing,   and   two   special administrative regions (Hong Kong   Special Administrative Region and Macao   Special   Administrative   Region).   Due   to   its   superior   geographical   location   (see   Figure   1),   Become   an   international   city   with   a   population   of more   than   millions   (Hui   et   al.,   2020).   As   one   of the   regions with the fastest economic development in the world in the past 30 years, the problem of   fog    and    haze   has   become    increasingly    serious,    and    the    environmental    and    human    health   problems caused by it have   attracted more and   more   attention   (Liu   et   al.,   2021).   Air   pollution   is   a   difficult problem   faced   by   most   developing   countries   in   the   process   of urbanization   and   industrialization.   More   and   more   attention   has   been   paid   to   the   investigation   and   study   of   atmospheric   environment.Over   the   past   few   decades,   with   rapid   urbanization   and   industrialization,   large   amounts   of   Particulate matter   (PM) have been emitted into   the   atmosphere,   resulting   in   some   severe   haze   episodes   everywhere.   PM2.5      (particulate   matter   with   an   aerodynamic   diameter   ≤   2.5      μm)   has   been   shown   to   have   a   significant   impact   on   the   climate   system   and   human   health   (Changetal.,   n.d.; Chen et al., 2021) and aroused wide public concern. The Chinese   government   has   taken a   series      of      emission      reduction      measures      and      achieved       some       success,      but      the       average   concentration   of   particulate   matter   is   still   higher   than   the   World   Health   Organization's   health standard, especially in the central and eastern plains and basins of   China. At the sametime, the concentration   of   ozone   (O3) continues   to   increase, and   now   ithas   become   one   of   the   important atmospheric    pollutants    in    the    lower    urban    areas.    In    the    past      10    years,    the      global    ozone   concentration has shown a rising trend   (Wang et   al.,   2023).   From   2010   to   2021,   some   scholars   have found that O3   pollution occurs frequently all over China, especially in central and southern   China,   especially   in   coastal   cities(Wang   et   al.,   2023).   O3      can   increase   the   oxidation   of   the   atmosphere,   promote    the    oxidation    of    SO2,    NO2    and    VOCs    in    the    atmosphere    and    the conversion of   gas particles into particulate matter, and then enhance the pollution of   PM2.5    and other   particulate   matter. High   concentrations   of ground-based   O3    also   increase   the   frequency   of   urban   photochemical   smog   (Quet   al., 2023).Although   ground-based   observation   technology   has   the   advantage   of   high   accuracy   for   air   pollutant    monitoring,    its    shortcomings    are    also    obvious.    Taking    PM2.5          observation    as    an   example,   up   to   now,   there   is   relatively   lack   of observation   means   for   PM2.5,   poor   systematic   data,    sparse    distribution    of   stations,   and   inability   to   obtain   large-scale    spatial    distribution   characteristics   of   PM2.5,   while   satellite   remote   sensing   covers   a   wide   range.   The   inversion   information   is   more   comprehensive,   which   can   effectively   make   up   for   the   shortcomings   of   ground   monitoring   stations   in   space.   Therefore,   the   use   of   satellite   remote   sensing   data   to   analyze      the      regional      distribution      and      change      of    PM2.5,      atmospheric      aerosol    and       other   atmospheric components has gradually become an important technical means.   Satellite remote   sensing   technology   can   provide   distribution   information   of various   atmospheric   components   including   aerosol   optical   thickness   (AOD   or   AOT)   at   regional   and   even   global   scales,   and   provide   an   effective means for understanding pollution   distribution,   sources and   interregional   transmission   processes   at   different    scales    (Y.   Zhang   et   al.,   2021;   Zhao   et   al.,   2023).    The   significant increase   of   aerosol content in the atmosphere not   only poses   a   great threat   to   urban   air quality, but also has a great   impact   on   regional   environment   and   climate   (Gao   et   al.,   2023).   Studies   have   shown   that   there   are   interaction   and   transport   problems   of air   pollution   among   cities   (Q. Zhang et al., 2022),   so the   distribution   characteristics   of aerosols are   closely   related to   the   sources   of   pollutants. Among   the   parameters   that   characterize   the   physical   properties   of aerosols, AOD   reflects   the   extinction   effect   of   aerosol   particles   on   solar   radiation,   which   can be   used   to   calculate   the   aerosol   content   and   assess   the   degree   of atmospheric   pollution    (S.   Zhang   et   al.,   2020). The   research   results    of   the    above    scholars    have    important    reference    significance    for    the   investigation   of the   current   situation   of   air   pollution   in   the   Guangdong-Hong   Kong-Macao   Greater   Bay   Area   and   the   in-depth   understanding   of   the   characteristics   and   causes   of   air   pollution, but most   of these   studies   are   aimed at   a   short period   of   time   or carry   out   long-term   analysis      based      on      a      single      element      of      air      pollution.      However,      the      investigation      of      the distribution   status   of pollutants   in   different   time   scales   and   different   Spaces,   the   long-term   change rules and evolution characteristics are less discussed. Based on ground observation data   and   satellite   remote   sensing   data,   taking   PM2.5      and   O3    as   examples,   this   paper   analyzes   the   investigation   and   spatio-temporal   evolution characteristics   of air pollution   in the   Guangdong-   Hong   Kong-Macao   Greater   Bay   Area   based   on   ground   observation   and   satellite   monitoring   data   and   the   current   situation   of air   pollution   in   the   Guangdong-Hong   Kong-Macao   Greater   Bay   Area,   focusing   on   the   pollution   characteristics   presented   in   different   time   and   space.   Through comparison and correlation coefficient calculation, we can find   out how   satellite   data   and   ground   data   help   us   better   understand   the   changes   of   air   quality   overtime   and   space,   so   as to      provide      scientific      basis      for      the      system      construction      of    environmental       governance,   environmental protection and emission reduction measures.

3 Research Data and Method 
3.1 Site monitoring data Two    types    of    ground    data      were      used      for      the      analysis.      The      first      category      is    based      on environmental monitoring data obtained from   hourly monitoring data of   56 observation stations   in    the    Greater    Bay    Area    from    2015    to    2021    provided    by    the    Ministry      of    Ecology    and   Environment,   PRC   (http://www.mee.gov.cn/),   including   PM2.5      and   O3-8h   air   pollutant   data.   The    second    type    of   surface    data    is    the    Daily      value    dataset    (V3.0)    of   the    China    Surface   International Exchange   Climatologica代 写GEOG0016 The Practice of Geography 2023-24

3.2 Satellite observation data The   annual average   PM2.5    concentration   data   is based   on the   ground-based PM2.5      observation   data   of   the   Guangdong-Hong   Kong-Macao   Greater   Bay   Area   from   January   2015   to   December 2021   and   the   inversion   of   AOD   (Aerosol   Optical   thickness)   products   of   the   three   satellite   platforms   MODIS,   SeaWiFS   and   MISR.   In   the   inversion   process,   the   atmospheric   column   content   AOT   was   correlated   with   the   surface   AOT   by   using   the   Goddard   Earth   Observation   System   chemical   transport   model   GEOS-Chem,   and   the   comprehensive   estimate   of PM2.5    in   the   region was   obtained.   By   considering   the   interannual variation   between   ground-based   and   non-ground-based observation data, the PM2.5   concentration at the grid points was extrapolated   to   2000,   so   as   to   obtain   the   long-term   series   PM2.5    grid   point   data   from   2000 to   2016, with   a   spatial          resolution             of          0.01°             ×          0.01°   .             Based          on             satellite             O3                   products             from https://www.temis.nl/protocols/O3total.php,    the    time      range      is    between      January      2015      and December 2021, the   spatial   resolution of 0.25   ° x 0.25   °   .   The   above   satellite   data   is processed using   MeteoInfo   software(http://meteothink.org/).
3.3 analytical method 
(1)   Kriging   interpolation method. Kriging   interpolation method   is based   on variance   function      theory and structural analysis, and estimates the attribute value of   any point in space   according      to   the observed   values of   several discrete   points   known in space (OLIVER      WEBSTER, 1990).   The    spatial    distribution   of   pollutants   was   analyzed   by   Kriging   interpolation   for   the   mass      concentration data of   each pollutant station in the   study area.
(2)   Spearman rank coefficient method.   Spearman rank coefficient   correlation   method   is   often   used   to   evaluate   the   change   rule   of   various   pollutants   over   time, to   quantitatively   analyze   the change      trend      of      various      pollutants,       and      to         evaluate      the      correlation      between      variables (“Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient,” 2008). Spearman rank correlation method was   used   to   analyze   the   spatial   variation   trend   of   pollutants,   and   the   correlation   between   pollutants   and meteorological factors and social and economic factors was   analyzed.
4 Analysis 
4.1 Temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of PM2.5 and O3 concentrations measured on the ground Using    the    collected    observation    data      from      environmental      monitoring      stations,      the      PM2.5   concentration   and pollution   level   in different cities were plotted   over   time   from   2015   to   2021   to    analyze    their    temporal    and    spatial    distribution    characteristics.    By    calculating    the    daily   average   PM2.5    concentration   of different   cities   and comparing   it with the national   ambient   air   quality standards, different pollution levels are divided.Ozone   has   become   one   of   the   important   atmospheric   pollutants   in   the   urban   near-ground.   The average    daily   concentration   of   O3-8h   at   ground   environmental   observation    stations   in   the   Greater Bay Area from 2015 to 2021 was collected and compared with the national ambient air quality   standards   to   reveal   the   spatial   and   temporal   distribution   characteristics   and   pollution levels   of   ozone.

Figure 3   Spatial distribution of   mean PM2.5    concentration from 2015 to 2021
4.2 Spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of PM2.5 andO3 concentrations based 
on satellite data Based   on   the   spatial   and   temporal   distribution   characteristics   of PM2.5    and   O3    concentrations      measured   on   the   ground, the   above   content   is   based   on   the   daily   mean   concentrations   of   PM2.5      and   O3-8h   observed   at   stations   from   2015   to   2021   to   analyze   the   characteristics   of the   inter-      annual changes and   spatial   differences   of   pollution   concentrations   and pollution   levels.   It   is a      specific description of   the pollution situation of   single station, single element and hour by hour.      In      order      to      conduct    a       more      comprehensive      and      integrated      survey      of    the      atmospheric      environment      of    the      whole      GBA      and      study      and      analyze      the      spatio-temporal    evolution      characteristics of   air pollution on a longer time scale, relevant   satellite products   are   introduced      and   special remote   sensing   data processing   software   or platform   (ENVI)   is used   for   data   pre-      processing, including radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, etc.   In   order   to   eliminate   the   atmospheric,   terrain   and   other   factors   on   the   observation   data.   GIS      technology   is   used   to   interpolate   andresample   the   processed   satellite   data,   generate   the   spatial    data    corresponding    to    the    ground    monitoring    station,    and    draw    the      spatial    and      temporal      distribution map.
4.3 Difference comparison between ground observation station data and remote sensing monitoring data First, for each ground   monitoring station, the corresponding satellite data coverage area is found   to   ensure   the   consistency   of the   space   time   period.   Spearman   rank   coefficient   was   used   to   evaluate   the   correlation   between   ground   measured   data   and   satellite   data   to   determine   the   strength of   the correlation between them. Then, the spatial distribution characteristics   obtained   from the two data sources are compared to   identify the   consistency   and   difference.
4.4 Comparison of changes in air data and the impact factors. Trends   and   anomalies   in   the   process   of obtaining   PM2.5   and   O3   concentrations   from   the   air   data   will   be   extracted.   In   an   effort   to   determine   what   is   influencing   the   air   changes,   we   will   compare   additional   data   from the   same   time period,   including wind   data,   traffic   data,   and the   implementation   of   new   policies.   By   way   of   illustration,   we   postulate   that   there   will   be   a transient    fluctuation    in      air      quality,      characterised      by      elevated      levels      of    PM2.5      and      O3,   throughout   the   National   Day   holiday   period,   when   the   volume      of   travellers      significantly increases.
4.5 Limitations of Analysis (1)   Data   reliability:   Ground   measurement   data   may   be   affected   by   factors   such   as   uneven   distribution   of monitoring   points,   equipment   failure   or maintenance.   Satellite   data   may   have   limitations   in   terms   of image   quality,   cloud   cover   and   atmospheric   correction.   These   factors may produce some error in the   analysis results.
(2)   Satellite data resolution limitations: Satellite data resolution   is   low, which   can   lead to   local   pollution   hotspots   or   spatial   changes   that   cannot   be   captured   at   smaller   geographic   scales.   Therefore,   for   a   specific region   or   city-level   analysis,   other high-resolution   data   sources may   need   to   be   introduced   to   improve   the   accuracy   of   the   analysis.
(3) Time   constraints: For long-term trend analysis,   longer   time   series   data   are   needed   to   draw   reliable   conclusions.   At   the   same   time,   because   the   atmospheric   environment   is   affected   by   many   factors,   the   analysis   of a   single   time   period   may   not   be   able   to   fully   capture   long-term   trends such as seasonal and   interannual   changes.
5 Expected Outcomes and Significance Through   the   analysis   of the   spatial   and   temporal   distribution   characteristics   of PM2.5    and   O3   concentrations    based    on    ground    measured    data    and      satellite    data,    it    is      expected    that    the   concentration   distribution   trend,   hot   spot   areas   and   pollution   level   changes   in   different   time   periods   and   spatial   locations   can   be   obtained.   These   analysis   results   have   important   guiding   significance   for understanding the   degree   of air pollution   in the   Greater Bay   Area,   the   spatial   distribution of   pollution sources, and the formulation and adjustment of   related policies. At the same   time,   comparative   analysis   can   verify   the   comparability   of ground   measured   data   and   satellite data, and   provide a   reference for further research and monitoring to improve the quality of   atmospheric   environment   and   protect   people's   health.
